Specify paths for each of the files and load them
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}

adjcount_path <- here("data", "dictionary_word_matrix_adj.csv")

Positive and negative affect words from PANAS X
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}
positive_words = c("active","alert","attentive","enthusiastic","excited","interested","proud","happy", "joyful","delighted","cheerful","lively","energetic","strong","confident","bold","daring","fearless")

```



Calculate mean frequencies for positive and negative affect
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}
# load adj matrix and sum across columns to compute the total size of each dictionary
adjcount <- read_csv(adjcount_path) %>%  
  mutate(dictsize = select(., abbreviated:zealous) %>% apply(1, sum, na.rm=TRUE))

word_count <- adjcount %>% 
  select(id, positive_words, negative_words, dictsize) %>% mutate_all(~replace_na(.x, 0))

# we'll express frequencies in terms of counts per 10000 tokens
unit <- 10000

# 
word_frequencies <- dict %>% 
  inner_join(word_count, by="id") %>%
  filter(dictsize >= 5000)  # only include dictionaries with more than 5000 tokens

# generate frequencies
for (word in c(positive_words, negative_words)){
  word_frequencies <- word_frequencies %>% mutate(!!sym(word) :=  unit * !!sym(word)/dictsize)
}

# calculate mean frequencies
word_frequencies$mean_positive<-rowSums(word_frequencies[,positive_words])
word_frequencies$mean_negative<-rowSums(word_frequencies[,negative_words])

# take the mean of the frequencies for each dictionary in order to merge into a single language
panas_frequencies <- aggregate(word_frequencies, by = list(language = word_frequencies$langname), FUN = mean)

#select relevant columns
panas_frequencies <- panas_frequencies %>% select(language, mean_positive, mean_negative)

```


Merge IMHE data with CIA data to obtain disorder prevelance by countries and languages spoken
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}
# Obtain Depressive Disorder Prevalence by Country
depression_prevalence <- mh %>%  filter(cause == "Depressive disorders")  %>% select(location, val, upper, lower)

temp1 <- merge(x= depression_prevalence, y = lang_countries, by.x = "location", by.y = "Country")
```


Merge temporary dataset with panas frequencies
```{r loaddata, include=TRUE}
# TODO
